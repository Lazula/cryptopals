Easy
-Add header includes to source files and remove function prototypes from *.c
-Change compile scripts to Makefiles

Moderate
-Add compiler warnings (-Wall -Wextra) and fix.
-Fix various UB, particularly strict aliasing violations in aes.c
-Make all code C89-compliant (add -std=c89 -pedantic to flags)
